# Birth Distribution Analysis

This repository contains data and code for analyzing the birth distribution by day of a month. The analysis aims to understand the frequency of births on each day and visualize the distribution using a histogram and bar plot.

## Data

The birth data used for the analysis is stored in the `births.csv` file. It contains the following columns:

- `day`: The day of the month on which the births occurred.

## Code

The analysis is performed using Python programming language. The code is available in the `births.ipynb` file. The main steps of the analysis include:

1. Reading the birth data from the `births.csv` file.
2. Calculating the birth count per day.
3. Creating a bar plot to visualize the birth distribution by day.

To run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- plotly

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install plotly 
pip install statsmodels
```
Run The code using
```
python -m streamlit run main.py
```

After installing the dependencies, you can execute the code.


The output plot will be displayed on the screen.

## Results

The analysis generates a bar plot that represents the birth distribution by day. Each bar corresponds to a day of the month, and the height of the bar indicates the number of births on that day. The plot provides insights into the frequency of births on different days of the month.
